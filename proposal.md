### Link to GitHub repository
https://github.com/vaughnswanson/Programming-for-Digital-Arts-Final-Project\

### Description
In this game you will defent your self from "freaks" trying to get to you. you play as a turret that shoots the "freaks" as they try to get to you. the game will have waves of enemys that grow as time goes on. It will be a time trial game so the goal is to last as long as you can with the waves comming at you.

### Perspective Features:

enemys with randomised stats like speed health and appearance made using classes

turret player character that can rotate and fire and possibly upgrades made using a list

using pixel art to bring the game to life. 


### Challenges

I will need to research how to put premade images into the game using py.game 

I will also need to research how to make those images move and rotate and gow to fire bullets based on that rotation 

as well as creating hitboxes and hurt boxes for the bullets and the objects with health. 


### Ideal Outcome

that this game is functonal and enjoyable to play even if it is simple


### Minimal Viable Outcome

that the game functions on a basic and recognisable level. enemys move, turret shoots etc.


### Milestones

#1 create logic for enemys stats and turrets stats

#2 emplement turret rotating and fireing

#3 emplement enemys spawning and advancing forward

#4 emplement enemys hit box and bullet hurt box

#5 emplement loose condition and time lasted / points earned
